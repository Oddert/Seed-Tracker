# Seed Tracker Monorepo

An extensible, flexible inventory, scheduling, and task tracking system to organise the purchasing, stock tracking, pre-planning, and recording of seeds & other garden resources.

## Problem Definition (brief)

If you're like me you collect seed packets like Pokemon cards. When in shops you forget what you've got, buy more than you need, and then realise its not even the thing you were looking for.

At home, drawers fill with half-used seeds packets, some still usable, others out of date, some that you need, others more of a 'someday / maybe'.

A "jobs for the weekend" type list makes its way across your screen, you realise the time has already just passed or you had to get your online order in three months ago.

Tracking inventory, purchasing new inventory, and planning tasks ahead are all overlapping yet distinct tasks. All are required in some degree to actually do physical work, but all detract from doing the work.

## Design Philosophy

Designed to incorporate some latest best practice and data design ideas, this project looks to resolve common issues with other garden-planing and task apps though a number of strategies.

### Eternal Brain

If implemented well, this application should function like an intelligent database, helping the user understand what they've got, what they need, and what's possible, without taking away from the intangibility, intuition, and physicality of actually planting and doing.

The aim of this project is to address common frictions in the more administrative side of inventory management and planing, in order to free headspace up to focus on the actual physical tasks of gardening.

It is hoped that by doing this, the app will also be able to help with the 'fear of missing out' (FOMO) that accompanies the feeling of having fumbled a window to do things.

In other words, it is an app that explicitly wants to 'get out of the way'; not to take tasks away from the gardener, or to try to enforce a system ontop of them (or for that matter to give them more tasks!).

### Physical Inventory fist approach

### Focus on opportunity windows instead of plans

### Use of an abstract hierarchy to tag, categorise and sort

### No single source of truth
